                Hummus is one of my favorite foods, so of course I'm including a recipe for it! This recipe and the image are from <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/how-to-make-hummus/">The Mediterranean Dish</a>. 
            </h2>
            She describes the recipe as:<br><br>
            "Most everyone knows hummus. Itâ€™s the quintessential Middle Eastern dip made by blending chickpeas with tahini, garlic, and citrus.
<br><br>
            I grew up on it, and I'm convinced that this simple beige dip is some of the best stuff on earth! Creamy, satisfying and packed with plant-based protein."

                <li>3 cups cooked chickpeas, peeled</li>
                <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>3 to 4 ice cubes</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (79 grams) tahini paste</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>Hot water (if needed)</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Sumac</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add chickpeas and minced garlic to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until a smooth, powder-like mixture forms.</li>
                <li>While processor is running, add ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth consistency.</li>
                <li>Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of Early Harvest EVOO. Add a few chickpeas to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies.</li>
            </ol>
